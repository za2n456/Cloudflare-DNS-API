# Contributing

Pull Requests are welcome. Consider filing an issue first to discuss your needs and plans. All project participation is subject to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Pull Requests
- Please follow the [PSR-2 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md). The easiest way to apply the conventions is to install [PHP Code Sniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer).
- Write any tests called for by your changes.
- Update code comments and README documentation as appropriate.
- Consider release effects. We practice semantic versioning, so breaking changes will require a major version release.
- Create topic branches.
- One pull request per feature.

## Running Tests
``` bash
$ vendor/bin/phpunit
